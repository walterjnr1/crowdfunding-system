# crowdfunding-system
I built a crowdfunding system using PHP and MySQL, designed to allow users to create and support various fundraising campaigns. The system offers a user-friendly interface where individuals or organizations can set up campaigns, specify goals, and track contributions.

Key features include:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles securely.
Campaign Creation and Management: Campaign creators can add details like title, description, target amount, and funding duration.
Donation System: Donors can contribute to campaigns via a simple and seamless donation form.
Payment Integration: (Optional) The system can be integrated with payment gateways to handle secure financial transactions.
Admin Panel: Admins can review campaigns, manage users, and monitor donations in real-time.
Real-Time Tracking: Campaign pages display live donation progress, showing how much has been raised towards the goal.
Email Notifications: Automated emails notify users about successful donations and updates on campaigns they are supporting.
The back-end is powered by MySQL, ensuring fast and reliable storage of user data, campaign information, and donation records, while PHP handles server-side logic, making the system dynamic and responsive.
